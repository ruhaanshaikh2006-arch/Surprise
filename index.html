        <h2>To Ilma, with all my love</h2>
        <p>You're the best thing that ever happened to me. I love your face, your smile, your personality—everything. You're absolutely perfect in my eyes. You mean so much to me. You've made me a better, brighter person. I love you through your worst, and your best, and everything in between. I feel like the luckiest person in the world when I'm with you. I love you more than words can express. I don't think I could live without you, without your presence. I support you through everything you do. I feel so safe when I'm with you; I can be myself. When you're happy, I'm even happier seeing you happy. I'm here for you no matter what. I want you to tell me your problems and I want you to tell me your successes. I think about you all the time. I LOVE YOU SOOO MUCH MY LOVE, MY WIFE.</p>

        <p>There's this poetry and the moment I read it my first thought was you: "I wish I was one of your tears so that I'll be born in your eyes, run down your cheeks, and die on your lips." This poetry—or even every word—can't even come close to define your beauty. My love, you look perfect.</p>

        <p>I love you more than I express. I'm sorry I've hurt you many times. I love you more than anything, mera baccha. Your presence lifts me. Your kindness, patience, and the way you see the world make me try to be better every day.</p>

        <p>You changed me into a better man. Where I used to worry and doubt, you taught me patience. Where I used to rush, you taught me presence. Where I used to hide my feelings, you taught me to share them. You are the reason I work to be the best version of myself—and I do it because you deserve it.</p>
